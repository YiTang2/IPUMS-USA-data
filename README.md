# Analyzing ACS Respondent Counts with IPUMS USA

## Overview

Data from IPUMS USA's 2022 American Community Survey (ACS) is analyzed in this research. The main goal is to use the ratio estimator approach to estimate the total number of respondents in each state based on the number of respondents who have doctorates. The actual number of respondents from the ACS dataset is then contrasted with this estimate.
